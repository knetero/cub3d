# Libft

This project aims to make you code in C a library of usual functions that you will be able to use for your next projects.

# Project description

Since in most 1337 projects we can't use any of the standard C library functions, the goal of this first project is to replicate some of the usual functions ourselves, as well as some additional functions.
We have to build a library that we will be able to use in our future projects.
